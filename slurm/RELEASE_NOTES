RELEASE NOTES FOR SLURM VERSION 14.11
6 June 2014


IMPORTANT NOTE:
If using the slurmdbd (Slurm DataBase Daemon) you must update this first.
The 14.11 slurmdbd will work with Slurm daemons of version 2.6 and above.
You will not need to update all clusters at the same time, but it is very
important to update slurmdbd first and having it running before updating
any other clusters making use of it.  No real harm will come from updating
your systems before the slurmdbd, but they will not talk to each other
until you do.  Also at least the first time running the slurmdbd you need to
make sure your my.cnf file has innodb_buffer_pool_size equal to at least 64M.
You can accomplish this by adding the line

innodb_buffer_pool_size=64M

under the [mysqld] reference in the my.cnf file and restarting the mysqld.
This is needed when converting large tables over to the new database schema.

Slurm can be upgraded from version 2.6 or 14.03 to version 14.11 without loss of
jobs or other state information. Upgrading directly from an earlier version of
Slurm will result in loss of state information.


HIGHLIGHTS
==========
 -- Added support for reserving CPUs and/or memory on a compute node for system
    use.
 -- Added support for allocation of generic resources by model type for
    heterogenous systems (e.g. request a Kepler GPU, a Tesla GPU, or a GPU of
    any type).
 -- Added support for non-consumable generic resources that are limited, but
    can be shared between jobs.

RPMBUILD CHANGES
================


CONFIGURATION FILE CHANGES (see man appropriate man page for details)
=====================================================================
 -- Modify etc/cgroup.release_common.example to set specify full path to the
    scontrol command. Also find cgroup mount point by reading cgroup.conf file.
 -- Added SchedulerParameters options of bf_yield_interval and bf_yield_sleep
    to control how frequently and for how long the backfill scheduler will
    relinquish its locks.
 -- To support larger numbers of jobs when the StateSaveDirectory is on a
    file system that supports a limited number of files in a directory, add a
    subdirectory called "hash.#" based upon the last digit of the job ID.
 -- Added GRES type (e.g. model name) and "non_consume" fields for resources
    that are limited, but can be shared between jobs.
 -- Added ChosLoc configuration parameter in slurm.conf (Chroot OS tool
    location).
 -- Added MemLimitEnforce configuration parameter in slurm.conf (Used to disable
    enforcement of memory limits)
 -- Added PriorityParameters configuration parameter in slurm.conf (String used
    to hold configuration information for the PriorityType plugin).
 -- Added RequeueExit and RequeueExitHold configuration parameter in slurm.conf
    (Defines job exit codes which trigger a job being requeued and/or held).
 -- Add SelectTypeParameters option of CR_PACK_NODES to pack a job's tasks
    tightly on its allocated nodes rather than distributing them evenly across
    the allocated nodes.
 -- Added PriorityFlags option of Calulate_Running to continue recalculating
    the priority of running jobs.
 -- Add new node configuration parameters CoreSpecCount, CPUSpecList and
    MemSpecLimit which support the reservation of resources for system use
    with Linux cgroup.


DBD CONFIGURATION FILE CHANGES (see "man slurmdbd.conf" for details)
====================================================================


COMMAND CHANGES (see man pages for details)
===========================================
 -- Improve qsub wrapper support for passing environment variables.
 -- Modify sdiag to report Slurm RPC traffic by type, count and time consumed.
 -- Enable display of nodes anticipated to be used for pending jobs by squeue,
    sview or scontrol.
 -- Modify squeue --start option to print the nodes expected to be used for
    pending job (in addition to expected start time, etc.).
 -- Add srun --cpu-freq options to set the CPU governor (OnDemand, Performance,
    PowerSave or UserSpace).
